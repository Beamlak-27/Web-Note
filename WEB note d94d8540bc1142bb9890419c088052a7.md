# **HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language)**

**The Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.**

### **There are so many tags**

```jsx
/* Such as */
<!--...-->  	Defines a comment
<!DOCTYPE>  	Defines the document type
<html>      	Defines the root of an HTML document
<head>	      Contains metadata/information for the document
<header>    	Defines a header for a document or section
<title>       Defines a title
<body>	      Defines the document's body
<div>	        Defines a section in a document
<a>	          Defines a hyperlink
<b>	          Defines the bold text
<h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings
<img>	        Defines an image
<br>	        Defines a single-line break
<form>	      Defines an HTML form for user input
<button>	    Defines a clickable button
<footer>  	  Defines a footer for a document or section
```

# **CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)**

**The Cascading Style Sheets is a language we use to style an HTML  document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. There are so many ways to design our web like coloring, font size, Rotating text, Spinning text….etc.**

```jsx
//To link CSS to our HTML we use
 
<link ref="stylesheet" href="ourcss.css">
```

# JS(**JAVASCRIPT)**

**JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.** 

**JS can do:**

- **Change HTML Content**
- **Change HTML Attribute Values**
- **Change HTML Styles (CSS)**
- **Hide HTML Elements**
- **Show HTML Elements**

```jsx
//To link JS to our HTML we use

<script src="myscripts.js"></script>
```

# BOOTSTRAP

**Bootstrap is the world's most famous free CSS framework. There are some versions of Bootstrap**

**like B3, B4, and B5.**

- **B3: Bootstrap 3 is the most stable version of Bootstrap, and it is still supported by the team for critical bug fixes and documentation changes.**
- **B4: Bootstrap 4 is a newer version of Bootstrap; with new components, a faster stylesheet, and more responsiveness. However, Internet Explorer 9 and down is not supported.**
- **B5: Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap; with a smooth overhaul. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported, and jQuery is replaced with vanilla JavaScript.**

**BOOTSTRAP is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS, HTML, and JAVASCRIPT-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. It also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs.**

# **Breakpoints**

**Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.**

| Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extra small | None | <576px |
| Small | sm | ≥576px |
| Medium | md | ≥768px |
| Large | lg | ≥992px |
| Extra large | xl | ≥1200px |
| Extra extra large | xxl | ≥1400px |

# ****Grid system****

**Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.**

| xs<576px | sm≥576px | md≥768px | lg≥992px | xl≥1200px | xxl≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Container max-width | None (auto) | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| Class Prefix | .col- | .col-sm- | .col-md- | .col-lg- | .col-xl- |
| # of columns | 12 |  |  |  |  |
| Gutter width | 1.5rem (.75rem on left and right) |  |  |  |  |
| Custom gutters | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/gutters/ |  |  |  |  |
| Nestable | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/#nesting |  |  |  |  |
| Column ordering | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/#reordering |  |  |  |  |

# Container

**Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.**

- **Container  which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint**
- **Container-{breakpoint}  which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint**
- **Container-fluid  which is width: 100% at all breakpoints**

| Extra small<576px | Small≥576px | Medium≥768px | Large≥992px | X-Large≥1200px | XX-Large≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .container | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-sm | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-md | 100% | 100% | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-lg | 100% | 100% | 100% | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-xl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1140px |
| .container-xxl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| .container-fluid | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |

# Columns

**Learn how to modify columns with a handful of options for alignment, ordering, and offsetting thanks to our flexbox grid system. Plus, see how to use column classes to manage widths of non-grid elements.**

**Alignment: Use flexbox alignment utilities to vertically and horizontally align columns.**

**Vertical alignment: Change the vertical alignment with any of the responsive `align-items-*` classes.**

**Horizontal alignment: Change the horizontal alignment with any of the responsive `justify-content-*` classes.**

**Column wrapping: If more than 12 columns are placed within a single row, each group of extra columns will, as one unit, wrap onto a new line.**

**Column breaks: Breaking columns to a new line in flexbox requires a small hack: add an element with `width: 100%` wherever you want to wrap your columns to a new line. Normally this is accomplished with multiple `.row`s, but not every implementation method can account for this.**
